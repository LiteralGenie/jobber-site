// Header is an outer container with an inner text elem
// It slides down into view once the underlying page is scrolled
// The container is sticky with height 0 so that it doesn't occupy space while hidden
//     (the text needs it's own elem (<Paper />) otherwise the background looks weird with height 0)
// We also can't simplify this setup with position absolute because absolute elems don't account for scrollbar in their width
